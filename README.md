# Context

This project was carried out as part of an end-of-study project by 4 Master 2 *Informatique pour l'Image et le Son* students from the University of Bordeaux.

In this project, the aim is to allow users to visualise, in Augmented Reality, their water consumption. This tool will represent a realistic volume of water, in a space manually defined by the user, which corresponds to a quantity consumed over a period of one day, one week, one month or one year. The aim is to design a fun application to encourage the user to reuse the application in their daily life.
